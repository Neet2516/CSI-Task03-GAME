# CSI-Task03-Game

This is the CSI task of making a game using HTMLCSS and Javascript . Here we are to choose any of the libraries or the frameworks for the accomplishment of the task . Any type of library is appreciable while proceeding with  the task . I have decided to generate the  Gane which uses  VITE and Vanilla as the framework 

Kaplay js is used here which  is earlier known to  be kaboon js
